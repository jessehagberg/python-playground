A place to play with python

#whoAmI
Professionally I am a former .NET developer and Systems Administrator of 10 years turned IT Project Manager, Account Manager and now Client Services Director for a UK based software company.  I've taken a semi-sabatical to sail to the Caribbean with my wife and 2 kids for 8 months on our 41' Morgan Classic sailboat called "Fairchild".  Personally I merge enthusiasm for technology and outdoor activities.

#whatIsThis
While enjoying the particular challenges and rewards of managing staff and customer relationships, I still have an increasingly unscratched itch of building/creating/inventing that programming and tech infrastructure architecture used to fulfil.  Time to learn a new programming language and start tinkering with things relevant to my interestes.  This is my "hello-world" Git repository and playground.  Currently I'm picking up python and have a whole host of little scripty projects I can see using it for.
